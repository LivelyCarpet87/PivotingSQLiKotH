    <h1>Filters</h1>
    <p>Filters are crucial in this game. If any field contains an item in the filters, the server will ignore the request.
      Thus it is very important to make filters to protect input from SQL injection. Be aware if you are blocking database
      queries though. Filters ignore case and all spaces when comparing. It is highly recommended to filter SQL keywords.</p>
    <h1>Plan Your Routes</h1>
    <p>You can plan your routes to prevent being cut off and to cut off other players.</p>

    <h1>Nodes</h1>
    <p>Initially in the game, your team controls 2 nodes. You should defend these nodes to maintain access
      to the rest of the network and gain valuable points. As shown on the map above, nodes are connected
      to other nodes in a specific layout, so you must navigate the network to attack high-value targets and
      defend your connections. Remember that some connections are one way, meaning that the attacked node cannot
      retaliate. In these cases, try to cut off your opponent as a defensive measure.
    </p>
    <h1>Breaking In</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to break in, including password extraction, guessing, and other things. Do not limit your thinking to sql injection!</p>
    <h1>Scoring</h1>
    <h4>Best Targets</h4>
    <p> Database nodes give the most points, and should be well defended!
    </p>
    <p> Contested nodes between teams can be a safer and more reliable way to
      earn points, and you cut off enemy teams from the special node.
    </p>
    <h4>Scoring Changes</h4>
    <p>The admin may change the scoring to promote/nerf behavior</p>
